## Motivation
I wanted to have my BeReals in my own gallery, but the app doesn't allow to export BeReals in bulk. So I created this tool to make it easy to export my BeReals from time to time. It also embeds the BeReal date into the image's EXIF data so it's placed correctly next to other photos in your photo timeline.
## Features

- Automatic token refresh üîÉ
- Export one or more days üìÖ
- Support for multiple BeReals ü§≥
- BeReal date embedded in EXIF data ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Shift multi-select ‚å®Ô∏è


## How To Use
This project is only meant to run locally on your own computer.


Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vascyt/bereal-memories
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd bereal-memories
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Finally, you need to set your access & refresh token in the web ui, which are then stored in the local storage of your browser.

This is currently required because I haven't implemented the authentication flow (yet). But this should only be necessary once, as the access token will be automatically refreshed when it expires, so please don't change them once they are set.
